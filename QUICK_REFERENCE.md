3. **Fishing locations** - Secret Spot has best catches but lower success rate
4. **Work streaks** - Build them up for bonus multipliers
5. **Early game** - Farm /work and /fish until you have $10k+
6. **Mid game** - Start /hunt and /adventure for better items
7. **Late game** - /rob and /bankrob are viable but use as last resort

- Restart the bot or try in a different channel

**Cooldown error?**
- Wait the listed time and try again
- Different commands have different cooldowns

**Lost my money to a rob?**
